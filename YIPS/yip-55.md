## Simple Summary

Add Neutrino USD (USDN) with Buy-N-Hold strategy in yVaults.

## Abstract

Add Neutrino USD (USDN) with Buy-N-Hold strategy in yVaults.

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the YIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the YIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the YIP will address the issue!-->

Neutrino USD has achieved massive adoption throughout multiple blockchains. Started from Waves blockchain, it's now available in ERC-20 and BEP-20 standards. Due to signficant supply increase, Ethereum USDN holders demand for USDN presence in yVaults implementing Buy-N-Hold strategy.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the YIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
This is a high level overview of *how* the YIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
